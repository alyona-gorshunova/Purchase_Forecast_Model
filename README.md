# Purchase Forecast Model

You have a file containing data on purchases for last 3 months by weeks. Your task is to make a purchase prediction model for the next 3 months. Note that from 2020-02-02 to 2020-02-09 there was a special offer that increased sales by 7%.

To create a purchase prediction model for the next three months, we will use the Prophet library in Python. The model will be trained on historical data from the last three months, which includes a special offer that increased sales by 7% from February 2 to February 9, 2020.
